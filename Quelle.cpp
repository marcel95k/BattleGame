/* PROJECT BY MARCEL KIEHTREIBER
   _____________________________________________________________________________

   Short description:

   A set of maximum 4 players is going to fight each other with their
   characters to earn points. Each player is able to increase the character's
   attack/defend skills. The player with the hightest amount of points at the
   end wins the game.

   CHARACTERS:

   HEAVY:

   ATTACK: high (20 - 35) DEFEND: normal (15 - 30) PRECISION: low (1-5/3)

   DEFENDER:

   ATTACK: low (10 - 25) DEFEND: high (20 - 35) PRECISION: normal (1-3/2)

   PRECISE:

   ATTACK: low (10 - 25) DEFEND: normal (15 - 30) PRECISION: hig (1-2/1)

   INVADER:

   ATTACK: high (20 - 35) DEFEND: low (10 - 25) PRECISION: normal (1-3/2)

   Precision is calculated randomly. A smaller range between the numbers means
   a higher hitrate (e.g.: low PRECISION[1-5] number must be 3 to hit. The
   attack/defend values are a random number between the two numbers and are
   calculated randomly.

   INCREASING ATTACK/DEFEND SKILLS: (e.g.: HEAVY)

   Default: ATTACK (20 - 35) DEFEND (15 - 30)

   First increase: (either ATTACK OR DEFEND/NEVER BOTH IN ONE DRAW) ATTACK 
   (25 - 30) DEFEND (20 - 30)

   Second increase: (either ATTACK OR DEFEND/NEVER BOTH IN ONE DRAW) ATTACK
   (25 - 40) DEFEND (20 - 35)

   etc..

   Started: 10-04-2021 Last edit: 13-04-2021

   TO DO LIST:

		1. Finish scenarios 3 - 4 for label ZEROattackONE. (DONE)
		2. Finish scenarios 1 - 4 for label ONEattackZERO. (DONE)

   FUTURE TO DO'S:

		1. Make colored signs/characters for each player. (NOT Done)
		2. Make COINS for players. (Coins are used for increasing attack/defend skills. For every SUCCESSFULL attack the attacking player robs coins from the defending player.
